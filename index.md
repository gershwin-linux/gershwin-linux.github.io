# Gershwin GNU/Linux

This is the homepage of the Gershwin GNU/Linux distribution. Gershwin is a
binary distribution which attempts to stay as close to more traditional UNIX
systems. It consists of several components, including the `gpkg` package
manager (composed itself of the `pkgin` low-level management system and the
`mkpkg` build-from-source system). It also has its own init system, `ginitd`
and a service management scheme, designed to stay close to the BSD 'rc.d'
system.
